When you upload files, OverWrite It jumps into the scene to replace old file with uploading one.


== Description ==

**Be careful when using this plugin.**

Sometimes you may need to update files, like product or property photos, without deleting old one before uploading new one. In such cases you can use this plugin to replace old files with new ones.

OverWrite It makes a filename search in `wp-content\uploads` folder recursively and replaces first matching file with the uploading one.

Keep in mind there is no excluded files, folders or file types so **double check everything before uploading anything** while the plugin is active.
